# Week 1 Challenge - Sam Song

## Description

The goal of this exercise was to take existing code and improve it based on some instructions provided. This scenario is apparently one that is common in the industry when working as a software dev, so exposure and practice is the aim here.

Working through this exercise, I learnt how to read and interpret existing code, and how to 'clean' code to make it more legible for myself and future coders.

## Installation
